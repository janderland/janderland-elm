## Repeated Attacks
- concussion
- resonate
- alarm
- blunt

Little concussions continually jar me awake, shoving their
blunt force up my calf and through my knee, leaving a minor
sharpness in my patella, progressing into my thigh,
resonating through my abdomen, continually shaking me to
awareness. Round after round of alarms; repeated calls to my
tired consciousness.


## Blossoming Awareness
- blossom
- cycling
- vibrant
- loop

My mind is looping to the same clock, crawling back into the
center of my brain, only to explode outward with each
vibrant shake of my core. This convoluted awareness, cycling
from bulb to bloom and back to bulb again, is thoughtless in
quality and variant in quantity, growing and shrinking with
each wave, fading into the fatigue and nausea that are
steadily building, briefly spiked to life by the thuds of my
heavy feet.


## Gut Pain


## Mental Movement
- Consistency
- Movement
- Indirect

The mental movement is a normality transceding the change,
and my meta mind finds distant pleasure in its consistency.
