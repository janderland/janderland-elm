Have you ever fallen asleep in a cold room? And said "good night!" to the dark? And melted into your bed spread? Silent in thought? Only hearing your collapsing lungs?

Have you ever wondered if you would wake up? Doubting the life left within? A fearless doubt that doesn't pace? A peaceful doubt that doesn't care?

Have you ever watched yourself die? And with the help of your artistic eyes? Painted away your panting? And rested from the rodent's race?

Tonight I'm silent and that doesn't matter. Right now, nothing matters at all. So don't be dramatic, just close your eyes and sleep.
