<p>Have you ever fallen asleep in a cold room? <!-- more --> And said &#147;good night!&#148; to the dark? And melted into your bed spread? Silent in thought? Only hearing your collapsing lungs?</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered if you would wake up? Doubting the life left within? A fearless doubt that doesn&#8217;t pace? A peaceful doubt that doesn&#8217;t care?</p>
<p>Have you ever watched yourself die? And with the help of your artistic eyes? Painted away your panting? And rested from the rodent&#8217;s race?</p>
<p>Tonight I&#8217;m silent and that doesn&#8217;t matter. Right now, nothing matters at all. So don&#8217;t be dramatic, just close your eyes and sleep.</p>
