Little concussions continually jar me awake, shoving their
blunt force up my calf and through my knee, leaving a minor
sharpness in my patella, progressing into my thigh,
resonating through my abdomen, continually shaking me to
awareness, like round after round of alarms; repeated calls
to my tired consciousness.

My mind is looping to the same clock, crawling back into the
center of my brain, only to explode outward with each
vibrant shake of my core. This awareness, cycling from bulb
to bloom and back to bulb again, is thoughtless in quality
and variant in quantity, growing and shrinking with each
wave, fading into the fatigue and nausea that are steadily
building, briefly spiked to life by the thuds of my heavy
feet.

My stomach churns, like a vortex slowly growing. It mildly
calls to me.

## Mental Movement
- Consistency
- Movement
- Indirect

The mental movement is a normality transceding the change,
and my meta mind finds distant pleasure in its consistency.
