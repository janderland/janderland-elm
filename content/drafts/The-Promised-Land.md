I've been building this form of expression for a couple
years now, and what better form then self expression, so
this site's first words will be autobiographical.

Welcome to the _Land of Jander_, a testament to how I spend
my time. Besides providing me with a place for self
expression, __jander.land__ is my first Elm application, my
second code-generation pipeline, and a project that took way
more of my time then it should've.

The site's birth was during March of 2016. One of my good
friends, [Taylor Sarrafian](http://www.taysar.com) had
grabbed the amazing address of _taysar.com_. I loved it, and
wanted to find something equally as personal and smooth.
I immediately was drawn to _janderson.com_, but this address
and every one of it's variants had already been obtained.
I took to the lesser known extensions and realized _.land_
had recently been added into the mix. At this point it was
immediately obvious what this site would become:
__jander.land__, the amusement park sprouted from my mind.
My thoughts, sounds, and code could be presented on display
here for all to see.

Originally, it was built upon the Hexo Blog Framework
combined with some Sass and JavaScript I wrote. This setup
ultimately became too unwieldy for my liking, but not before
taking me through some interesting experiments. While
implementing searching for my blog's content, I had
a realization about blogs in general: you can model a blog
as a stream of posts passing through a bunch of filters.

I realized this feature could be viewed as a filter applied
to the stream of my blog posts. A filter reveals a subset of
all available data in a stream, throwing away bits of the
data that don't make the cut. This is essentially what
a search is doing; only revealing posts which fit the search
query. It wasn't long until I realized that pagination fit
this abstraction as well.

These realizations spawned the creation of one of my major
projects. At this point I hadn't discovered functional
programming, and while implementing a pagination feature,

Since then it has been completely rewritten with a focus on
content rather than features. I emerged from my rabbit hole
with the motto of "simple but original". I didn't want
factory default, I wanted something unique from the ground
up, and yet something actual instead of a longer bucket
list.


Narrative about what this site is. What is this site's
mission? It's to host and bost, for and about me. It's my
means of showcasing who I am, what I've worked on.
