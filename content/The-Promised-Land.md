I've been building this form of expression for a couple
years now. And what better form but self expression; so it's
first words will be about itself.

Welcome to the __Land of Jander__... a testament to how I spend my time.

Besides providing me with a place for self expression, __jander.land__ is my
first Elm application, my second code-generation pipeline, and a welcome return
to UI design. It's also burned up quite a bit of time.

![Old Site](/oldsite.jpg)

The site's birth was during March of 2016. Originally, it
was built on the Hexo Blog Framework, with a SMACSS Sass
stylesheet and a small bit of custom JavaScript. This custom
JavaScript spawned the creation of one of my major projects.
At this point I hadn't discovered functional programming,
and while implementing a pagination feature, I realized the
utility of a list of functions being applied to a stream of
data, the result of each function piped into the next.
I wrote a lot of imperative code to enable simple function
composition. This was my gateway to a new way of thinking.

Since then it has been completely rewritten with a focus on
content rather than features. I emerged from my rabbit hole
with the motto of "simple but original". I didn't want
factory default, I wanted something unique from the ground
up, and yet something actual instead of a longer bucket
list.

> I'm in love with functional programming. I want a honeymoon.

Well, I guess I'll go with Elm.

> I want the content to be sharable in a compact format.

Ok, we can write it in markdown.

> I also don't want any runtime errors. I'm using Elm after all.

Fine, using Node.js, we'll transpile the markdown into Elm
with the Elm compiler double checking our work.
