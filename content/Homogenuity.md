That's what they want, oneness. That's what we're all
seeking. We're afraid of change. We're tired. Let it end.
I can see that prespective, the longing for rest, for
nothingness. I don't mean nonexistence, as I've mistakenly
believed to desire before, no. This longing has a subtle
difference from the suicide. This isn't a longing for death,
it's longing for oneness.

The tribalists think it's here. They believe they've found
it. If we could only be all white, or all liberal, or all
Japanese, then maybe we could finally find peace and end the
wars. Ultimately, it's an evolution crafted by the fear of
death, fear being the personification of Darwinian justice.

At the end of the day, even efficiency is only sought after
to minimize change.

"How can I maximize meaning while minimizing waste?" But
what is waste really?... only that which is meaningless.
